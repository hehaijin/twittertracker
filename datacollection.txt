The data collection is using Python 3 with tweepy.
based on Adil Moujahid's blog:

with some modifications.
the code is in twittertreamer.py.

Using the code, I collected 64 MB of data, containing about 6400 tweets related to president Trump, in less than 10 miniuts. 

The preliminary data analysis is based on this small data set. For the project, a much larger data set spanning much longer time would be required.
